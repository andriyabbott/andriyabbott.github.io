      <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Andriy Abbott.  <br /> I’m from <strong>Vinnytsia</strong>, a city close to Kyiv, Ukraine. I’ve visited many countries, including India, Nigeria, and the Netherlands. <br /> In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and biking. I also like to watch movies and go out to theaters sometimes. I like long drives and have been slowly exploring the midwest. So far, Missouri seems to have a lot more fun things to do compared to the neighboring states. <br /> I also just finished an internship as an IT intern for Cummins this summer and had a great time. I met many interns and made new friends. I went on a few trips to Columbus, Indiana. At the Cummins factories, I saw how big diesel engines are made. It was a great summer. </p>    
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I am a senior at the University of Missouri. I will complete my undergrad degree in Information Technology at the end of this year. I am also completing a minor in Business.</p>
<p>Here's a quote I like:</p>
     <blockquote>"Life is trying things to see if they work." <em>-Ray Bradbury</em></blockquote>
