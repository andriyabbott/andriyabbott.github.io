            <h1>Welcome to Andriy's Website!</h1>
            <h4>Hello there! My name is Andriy Abbott and youâ€™ve located my portfolio website!</h4>

        <main>
                <p>The idea behind the content of this website is to showcase my experiences and  projects that I am proud of and eager to share with everyone who comes across it.  My Portfolio has been the culmination of my experiences mainly during my  undergraduate degree in IT as well as projects and internships that I have had the  fortune to be a part of as part of my experience in the real-world aspect of my  degree. An objective of this website would be for prospective employers to view  my skills and experiences in a dynamic setting that would showcase some of those  skills within the website itself through the design as well as links to other projects that I have been a part of that are stored in various repositories or demonstrations to completed projects.
