                <p style="background-color:#ad550e;text-align: center;">The idea behind the content of this website is to showcase my experiences and  projects that I am proud of and eager to share with everyone who comes across it. <br/> My Portfolio has been the culmination of my experiences mainly during my  undergraduate degree in IT as well as projects and internships that I have had the fortune to be a part of as part of my experience in the real-world aspect of my  degree. <br/> An objective of this website would be for prospective employers to view  my skills and experiences in a dynamic setting that would showcase some of those  skills within the website itself through the design as well as links to other projects that I have been a part of that are stored in various repositories or demonstrations to completed projects.
