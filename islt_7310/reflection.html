        <h3>Year 1</h3>
        <p class="fpar">My experience, so far, at the University of Missouri has been quite educational. It has helped me learn and grow a lot since I started in 2019. I’ve gone through a lot of ups and downs and learned how to adapt to uncomfortable situations. I’ve also learned to be more independent since I was dropped off at the dorms my freshman year. <br/> Something I have learned through my career and my academics being in the Information Technology program is that you only get the experience you want to be based on the effort you put into it. My first year involved me learning the very basics of coding and some overview of what IT is. It wasn’t much, but it gave me some foundation in the design principles and it set me up for future requirements.  
        </p>
        <h3>Year 2</h3>
        <p class="spar">My second year had me getting more involved with student groups as well as getting a  better idea of what I would want to do within the IT program. I took a lot of cybersecurity classes and a few classes on media design and technology. The year started with COVID  impacting everyone, which meant that a lot of the classes that were meant to be in-person were moved online which made things a bit difficult for hands-on portions, but it was still good as I could learn from mistakes made on my own a bit better.<br/> I also started working for the Division of IT at Mizzou in my second year, which helped me expand my IT  experience even further.  
        </p>
        <h3>Year 3</h3>
        <p class="tpar">My third year was by far, my most productive year in terms of career goals. I aimed to get an internship at some point during college and was applying fairly early in the semester. I landed one at Cummins for the summer and it was a very big dive into what the real world of IT looks like. I was involved in a corporate IT sector and was responsible for roles that I had no experience in before the internship. I learned that you don’t need to know everything about a job to get the job, but rather be willing to learn and adapt quickly because IT is a very fast-paced job environment and things are always changing so one has to keep adapting and learning. I also got more involved with development at school as well as did more research papers and projects rather than exams and the occasional quizzes which helped me learn better.  
        </p>
        <h3>Year 4</h3>
        <p class="lpar">My fourth year thus far has been off to a good start. I’m on track to graduate at the end of this academic year and look forward to working full-time soon. I’m completing my capstone project this semester which I hope to be a lot of fun even though it may seem challenging and daunting in the beginning. I am also looking forward to the remainder of my business classes for my business minor as I look forward to expanding my management skills project management is something I enjoyed doing at my internship and it would be a good skill to have.
