    Hello! My name is Andriy Abbott and I’m a senior studying IT at Mizzou. I’m from Vinnitsa, a city a few hours west of Kyiv, Ukraine.
    I do have some experience in web development from taking IT2830 as well as some experience gathered from work for the Division of IT at Mizzou and training from internships and side projects that I’ve worked on. 
    My expectations for this course are to fine-tune the web development skill that I have and to clarify any issues that I may have had with the previous experiences I have had with web development. 
    I also wanted to learn to eventually guide others about web development so this class sparked my curiosity.
    My favorite hobby at the moment is playing the guitar as I just got one over the summer and figured it would be good to learn how to play an instrument.
